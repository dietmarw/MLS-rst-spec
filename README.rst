Installation instruction
------------------------

On Windows:

In order to make sure that things work as epxpected we don't use
a globally installed Python version but install a local one.
This does not require any adminstrator privileges.

Simply double-click the ``installSphnix.bat`` to install Python
and Sphinx. Once done double-click on ``make-html.bat`` in order
to build the HTML version. The resulting HTML is then in
``build/html/index.html``.

If you want to build other formats have
a look at ``make.bat`` and its options.
